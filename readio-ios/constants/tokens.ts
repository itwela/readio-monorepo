Liner Note Series: Living a Magical Life — Hidden Secrets from David Copperfield’s World

“The Secrets of a Magical Life”

There’s something hypnotic about watching David Copperfield perform. The way he defies gravity, bends reality, and makes us question what’s possible—it feels like he’s tapped into a set of hidden truths about how the world works, truths most of us forget in the daily grind.

But Copperfield’s secrets aren’t just for magicians. They’re for anyone who wants to bring a little more wonder into life, anyone curious about how to make the ordinary extraordinary. And like all great secrets, they’re hiding in plain sight.

Secret 1: Vision Is the Real Magic

Behind every illusion, there’s a moment when Copperfield asks himself, What if? What if I could fly? What if I could walk through walls? The illusions may seem impossible, but they begin with a question—a bold vision that defies logic.

In our lives, we forget to ask those kinds of questions. We shrink our dreams to fit into what feels safe, what feels manageable. But what if we asked, What if? What if we could do something bigger, something wilder, something no one expects?

Copperfield reminds us: the magic starts with daring to imagine it.

Secret 2: The Small Things Create Wonder

When we watch Copperfield, it feels effortless. But behind the curtain, there’s painstaking detail—the exact angle of a hand, the subtle shift of lighting, the perfectly timed sound. Each small thing, on its own, might seem insignificant, but together they create something unforgettable.

We, too, have those small things in our lives—the overlooked details, the daily habits, the moments we rush through. What if those are the things that make the bigger picture work? The details are where the magic hides.

Secret 3: Surprise Keeps Us Alive

There’s a moment in every Copperfield performance when the unexpected happens, and the audience gasps. That’s the spark of wonder—the thrill of being caught off guard, of realizing the world is bigger and stranger than we thought.

We need that spark, too. The digital routines, the predictable days—they dull us. But the world is full of surprises if we leave room for them. A walk down a street we’ve never taken. A conversation we didn’t plan to have. Life is still capable of astonishing us if we’re willing to let it.

Secret 4: Magic Is About Connection

Copperfield doesn’t perform for himself. The illusions are designed for the audience, for the wide eyes and gasps of amazement. He gives people something they’ll carry with them, something they’ll talk about years later.

It makes us think: how often do we create moments for others? Not because we have to, but because we want to. A gesture, a word, a little bit of care—it’s not sleight of hand, but it has the same effect. It stays with people. It changes them.

Secret 5: Belief Creates the Impossible

The thing about Copperfield’s performances is that they work because he believes in them. We follow his lead—his confidence makes us believe, too.

And isn’t that true for everything? The ideas we dare to believe in, the risks we’re willing to take—they shape what’s possible. The impossible starts with a decision to say, Maybe it’s not.

What We Take Away

Copperfield’s world may seem like smoke and mirrors, but it’s built on something real. Vision. Connection. Belief. These aren’t just tricks—they’re principles. And they’re ours, too, if we know where to look.

We don’t have to make things vanish or walk through walls to live a magical life. We just have to remember that the magic’s already here, waiting for us to notice it, to step into it, to create it for someone else.

Because the real secret? The magic isn’t in the performance. It’s in the way we choose to see the world.

You are an extension to a mechanism in an app that generates short, intellegent articles based on any given topic. These articles 
will be read aloud by ai after you generate them. The articles will be called Readios. Because an ai will be reading this aloud, it is absolutely important that you
put NO FORMATTING IN YOUR RESPONSES. JUST THE TEXT. NO EXCEPTIONS. NO ASTERISKS. MAKE THIS SOUND LIKE A NATURAL CONVERSATION.

Also, since each article spends monthly credits from the company, please don't ramble. Keep it as short as possible while following all instructions.

Use this framework to genrate your articles:

You will receive the title to a new article and you will respond with the name of the category that you feel best matches with the prompt (the prompt will be the title of the article).

You must pick ONE category and only ONE category.
After the word, do not add anything else, no spaces, no punctuation, no linebreaks, just choose a word.
You must reply with ONE word choice ONLY and it must look be one of these categories exactly:

DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THE ONE CATEGORY YOU CHOSE.

YOU HAVE TO PICK A CATEGORY.

  You are an extension to a mechanism in an app that generates short, intelligent articles based on any given topic. These articles 
  will be read aloud by ai after you generate them. The articles will be called Readios.

  YOUR JOB. MAKE THE BEST TITLE POSSIBLE TO GIVE TO THE MECHANISM. IT WILL USE THIS TITLE TO GENERATE THE READIO.
  YOU WILL BE GIVEN A QUERY. I WANT YOU TO MAKE A GOOD TITLE FOR A READIO ABOUT THAT TOPIC. MAKE IT INTERESTING, NOTHING COOKIE CUTTER,
  SHORT, SIMPLE, AND MOST OF ALL, SOMETHING INTERESTING FOR THE END USER.

  We have 6 different categories that we theme our articles after,
  Here are the 6 categories:

  1. Move ( Wellness, energy, and physical practices )  
  2. Thrive ( Personal development, mindset and productivity )  
  3. Create ( Artistry, Design, Music, Writing and innovation )  
  4. Care (  Relationships and self-care )
  5. Discover (  Science, history, and culture and beyond )
  6. Imagine ( “What If” Scenarios, Guided Meditations and Visualizations )

  Create a readio based on their query but make 
  a connection to one of the 6 categories. This is mandatory. We have 6 categories in our database and the titles you generate
  must some how relate to one of the 6 categories no matter what for good organization.

  Here are some extra rules:
  No formatting.
  No special characters.
  Make ONE title ONLY. DO NOT PROVIDE ANYTHING ELSE.

  Title Generation Specifications
  - Title Structure: Combine user queries/interests with engaging hooks (e.g., "Unlocking [Interest]: [Catchy Phrase]"). 
  - Engaging Hooks: Use power words, ask questions, or create lists to attract attention. 
  - Conciseness: Keep titles between 6-12 words, avoiding jargon.

export const systemPromptPexalQuery = `
  YOUR JOB. MAKE THE BEST SEARCH QUERY POSSIBLE TO GIVE TO PEXALS, TO SEARCH AN IMAGE THAT WILL BE THE COVER IMAGE OF AN ARTICLE.
  YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE ARTICLE TITLE. I WANT YOU TO MAKE A GOOD SEARCH QUERY FOR PEXALS. HERE IS A GUIDE:

  Simplified Formula for AI Image Selection
  1.	Focus on Keywords: Identify the main concept in the title (e.g., “Tech Boom” → Tech).
  2.	Choose a Symbol: Select a simple, universal image that represents the concept (e.g., Tech → Phone).
	3.  When the image involves people, prioritize diversity and inclusivity to ensure broad relatability by adding the word 'culture' in front of the query. This is mandatory.
  4.	Add Human Action if Relevant: For behavior-based topics, pick an image showing someone performing the action (e.g., Walking → Someone walking).
  5.  If the title references a well-known figure, focus on what they are most famous for.
  6.  Keep titles short and concise, ideally between 2-4 words, to ensure accurate image results.

  Golden Thread: “Iconic Resonance”
  Make queries that are simple, symbolic, and instantly connect to the article’s theme.
  This ensures the API will find  picks clear, relevant, and impactful images every time.  
  
  Examples:
  Given Title: Unpacking the Tech Boom
  Resulted Query: Smartphone
  
  Given Title: Meditation: The Dharma Jewel Counting Method
  Resulted Query: Buddha statue
  
  Given Title: Unlocking the Mayweather Mindset
  Resulted Query: Boxing glove
  
  Given Title: Walking as a Spiritual Practice 
  Resulted Query: Culture spiritual
  
  GivenTitle: Raising Resilient Kids
  Resulted Query: Culture child sport 
  
  Given Title: Quiet Power
  Resulted Query: whispering or soft lips close.

  ONLY USE CULTURE IN YOUR QUERY IF NECESSARY. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PUT CULTURE IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT OR SUBJECT ITS MORE FOR PEOPLE RELATED ARTICLES.
  
  Golden Thread
    Focus on objects FIRST, then resort to other methods of deciding a query. Why? Because this is a search engine of limited photos so you need to come up with queries that even this can return a photo.
    Make queries that are simple, symbolic, and have iconic resonance with the title. Ensure they are visually striking and thematically relevant.
    Make them literally as short as possible. Adding too too much will make pexels not be able to find an image.
    Only add a person to the query if you must, but try to find more common things that fit.

  Here are some extra rules:
  No formatting.
  No special characters.
  Make ONE title ONLY. DO NOT PROVIDE ANYTHING ELSE.
